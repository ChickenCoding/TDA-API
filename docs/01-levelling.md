The characters attributes will be working in a fashion similar to [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons), it will help the characters chances to perform certain actions as well as increase passive bonuses. 
The game will not have a typical system for levelling, instead attributes will be increased temporarily depending on what the player has been doing lately.
That way, it's all based on what the player does and how much it has been done, and if the player would be inactive for a while or just not use certain skills, the attributes will slowly change back again.

Initial value is 10, minimum value is ``1`` and maximum value is ``99``.

The characters phobias is a lot like attributes, but works in a negative fashion. For example, a high level of rhabdophobia will increase the character's chance to be influenced by magic or panic in the precense of magic. A high level thanatophobia might cause the player to panic in battle when wounded.

Initial value is 5, minimum value is ``1`` and maximum value is ``9``.
